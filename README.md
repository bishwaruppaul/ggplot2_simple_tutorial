# A simple yet comprehensive tutorial of plotting with ggplot2 package in R

This tutorial is inspired from this amazing blog post: https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/

Though the post is very comprehensive, it can be a little too complicated and technical for a novice. So I decided to make this presenatation with the aim of being simplistic yet trying to cover as many ggplot features as possible.

The presentation can be found here: https://bishwaruppaul.github.io/ggplot2_simple_tutorial/

I used the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) R package to make the presentation.
